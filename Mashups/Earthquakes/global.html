            This was a tough assignment for me to accomplish based on my limited understanding
            of the ESRI world. Once my dataset was known to me the tools seemed rather
            intuitive. There was never a time, outside of getting the right data for
            the assignment, that I felt lost on what to do next. I was excited to be able to
            go back into the Require.js documentation to see how to remove my code for the
            UniqueValueRenderer and place it into a module. This allowed my code to be more
            clear upon initial reading. If I were to further break the code into modules
            I would also place the popup template code into its own module.
