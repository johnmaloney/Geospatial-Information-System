            This map initially displays all the earthquakes from the ESRI test layer <a href="http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Earthquakes/Since_1970/MapServer">here</a>.
            To change the layers that are on the map the user can use either browser prompts
            or the year slider to see the earthquakes from that year.

            This was a good lesson into using the query expressions to filter the data.
            I also learned the methods for removing layers from the Map object (i.e. Map.removeAll()).
            I have experience working with Javascript Promises, so it was pretty natural
            to be working with the asynchronous nature of those functions.
            I was impressed with the speed of the ArcGIS JS API when I added the slider
            to the page and reacted to each time the value was changed.
