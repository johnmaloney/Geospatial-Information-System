            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Twenty million veterans live in the United States. They
            live in every state and in nearly every county across the
            nation. About 5 million veterans lived in areas desig-
            nated as rural by the U.S. Census Bureau during the
            2011 – 2015 period. Understanding who rural veterans
            are and what sets them apart from other veterans, as
            well as from their rural neighbors, provides the neces-
            sary perspective for rural communities, government
            agencies, veterans’ advocates, and other policymakers
            interested in directing programs and services to this
            population.</p>
            <p>In general, individuals living in rural areas differ from
            their urban counterparts in terms of demographic
            characteristics, social ties, culture, and access to
            infrastructure and institutional support. Much depends
            on the geography itself. In some parts of the country,
            rural residents may face substantial physical barriers
            to accessing services and amenities, including longer
            travel times, lack of transportation options, and limited
            availability of services.</p>
            <p>Veterans, regardless of geography, differ from their
            nonveteran counterparts in a variety of aspects.
            Military history and enlistment policy changes have
            influenced the demographic composition of the veteran
            and nonveteran populations over time.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has identi-
            fied veterans living in rural areas as a population of
            interest. To help address concerns of veterans’ access
            to care, Congress established the Office of Rural Health
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentParagraphs">
            <p>within the VA in 2007. One challenge in these efforts
            is that most of the data available to the VA come only
            from rural veterans enrolled in their healthcare system,
            and not all veterans are enrolled. However, to antici-
            pate demand for care, as well as to understand what
            types of services may be requested or utilized, requires
            data on all rural veterans.
            </p>
            <p>This brief aims to answer the question “Who are rural
            veterans?” by considering the demographic, social, and
            economic characteristics of rural veterans compared
            with both urban veterans as well as with rural nonvet-
            erans. It also examines rural veterans by the level of
            rurality of their county of residence to understand some
            of the impact of geography on their characteristics. The
            data used in this report are primarily from 2011–2015
            American Community Survey (ACS), 5-year estimates.
            This report presents statistics about veterans and,
            where applicable, nonveterans 18 years and older living
            in rural and urban areas of the United States.
            </p>
            <h3>RURAL VETERANS BY REGION AND STATE</h3>
            <p>In the 2011–2015 period, 24.1 percent of the veteran
            population 18 years and older lived in areas designated
            as rural. Just under half of all rural veterans lived in the
            South (45.9 percent) and another 13.7 percent lived
            in the Northeast (see Table 1). While the Midwest and
            West may appear to have a larger share of wide-open
            rural spaces from the view outside an airplane window,
            the majority of the nation’s rural population, in general,
            actually lives east of the Mississippi River.
