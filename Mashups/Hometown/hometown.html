        <h3>What I learned from Lesson 3</h3>
        <p>The concepts in this lesson were not new to me, although interacting with the ArcGIS Javascript 
        API was. This API feels alot like working with Leaflets or Mapboxs javascript API’s and conceptually 
        does the same thing. I might lean towards using this API if I was comfortable with the idea that 
        ESRI would not try to force the use of their server technologies through the API. 
        I assume that they will use this API to market their server side technologies because in the end ESRI 
        needs to sell these services to make money. I do feel a little better about this knowing that the use of the javascript
        is licensed under the opensource Apache license. Hopefully they open the ability to alter and contribute to the 
        framework even more as time goes by.</p>
        <p>Overall, I think the API is easy to use and intuitive in its structure. I was initially concerned 
        that the javascript was built around the third party Dojo.js tool, but then on further review I learned 
        that ESRI made this flexible. Using RequireJS the ArcMap API allows widgets (e.g. esri/graphics, esri/symbols) 
        to be loaded within a third party framework. This is a smart choice on the part of the ESRI team in that it 
        allows the flexibility to use any type of framework that you as the developer chooses. Overall I think this 
        javascript API is a good tool to have and will bea true competitor to other high-quality API’s such as Mapbox and Leaflet. </p>
